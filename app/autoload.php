  *
  * If an attempt is made to instantiate an object is made with the keyword 'new', PHP looks
  * for the class definition.  If the relevant file has not been pre-included this function
  * is called, and the name of the class is passed in as a parameter.  This requires the
  * file name of the class definition file to be identical to the class.
  *
  * The function reads the names of the component directories, and looks in each in turn for the
  * class definition file.  If the relevant file exists, it is included, and the class instantiated.
