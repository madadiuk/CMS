# CryptoShow Management System (CMS)

## Project Overview
The CryptoShow Management System (CMS) is designed to facilitate the organization and management of computer hardware and software exhibitions, with a special focus on cryptographic devices. Developed for a society of computer hobbyists, including cybersecurity experts and computer history enthusiasts, CMS aims to streamline the planning and execution of regular exhibitions, enhancing both the organizer and attendee experience.

## Features
- **User Registration and Profile Management:** Allows attendees and exhibitors to sign up, manage their profiles, and register for upcoming shows.
- **Device Registration:** Enables exhibitors to list and describe the cryptographic devices they plan to bring, enriching the exhibition narrative and visitor learning experience.
- **Event Planning and Management:** Tools for organizers to schedule shows, manage exhibits, and communicate updates to participants.
- **Interactive Show Map:** A mobile-friendly feature to help attendees navigate the venue, find exhibits, and learn more about the displayed devices.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5 and CSS for a responsive and accessible web interface.
- **Backend:** Pure PHP for server-side logic, handling user registrations, device listings, event management, and more.
- **Database:** MySQL (consider extending the supplied data design and components as needed).

## User Experience Focus

##Discussion

The CryptoShow Management System (CMS) is envisioned as a comprehensive tool to address the specific needs of organizing and managing exhibitions of cryptographic devices and computer history artifacts. By leveraging HTML5 and CSS, the project ensures broad accessibility and a responsive user interface adaptable to various devices and screen sizes. The choice of Pure PHP as the backend technology allows for robust server-side processing capabilities, essential for handling dynamic content such as user profiles, device registrations, and event management tasks.

This project is not just about managing logistical details; it aims to enhance user engagement through features like interactive maps and detailed device descriptions. By focusing on user experience, CMS intends to serve both the dedicated members of the computer hobbyist society and the wider public with an interest in cryptography and computer history, ensuring that each exhibition is informative, engaging, and seamlessly organized.
